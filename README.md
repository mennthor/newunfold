# newunfold

Python unfolding implementation based on:
- Barlow, Beesten: Fitting using finite Monte Carlo samples (1993)
- Blobel: An unfolding method for high energy physics experiments (2002)


## Testdata

Data for building the response matrix and testing the unfolding is generated by the `lorentz` class. The generated data is the same as used by Blobel in his examples.

The pdf of the true distribution is the sum of three lorenz function normed correctly to unity:

	$$
	f_\text{true} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} b_k \frac{g_k^2}{(x-x_k^2) + g_k^2}
	$$

with the parameters
		| k | b_k | x_k | g_k |
		|---|-----|-----|-----|
		| 1 |  1  | 0.4 | 2.0 |
		| 2 | 10  | 0.8 | 0.2 |
		| 2 |  5  | 1.5 | 0.2 |
The normalization in the interval $[x_l, x_h]$ is:

	$$
	N = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{3} b_k g_k ( \arctan((x_h - x_k) / g_K)
				- np.arctan((x_l - x_k) / g_k) ) \right]^{-1}
	$$

The measured distribution is obtained from the true one by applying a limited acceptance probability, a systematic shift and a gaussian smearing. The acceptance probability is
	$$
	p_\text{acc} = 1 - \frac{(x - 1)^2}{2}
	$$

The function
	$$
	y_\text{shift} = x - \frac{x}{20}
	$$

shifts the data. The smearing is applied with a standard normal distribution with $\sigma=0.1$. An example with 10000 numbers is shown below.
