# newunfold

Python unfolding implementation based on:
- Barlow, Beesten: Fitting using finite Monte Carlo samples (1993)
- Blobel: An unfolding method for high energy physics experiments (2002)


## Testdata

Data for building the response matrix and testing the unfolding is generated by the `mc_data_gen` class. The generated data is the same as used by Blobel in his examples.

### Training
The model is trained (the response matrix is build) with a flat spectrum, which is simply generated from a uniform distribution
	$$
	f_{MC} = \frac{1}{x_h - x_l}
	$$

### Testing
For the actual unfolding part a triple lorentzian is used. The pdf of the true distribution is the sum of three lorentz function normed correctly to unity:
	$$
	f_\text{true} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} b_k \frac{g_k^2}{(x-x_k^2) + g_k^2}
	$$

with the parameters

 k | b_k | x_k | g_k
--:|----:|----:|----:
 1 |  1  | 0.4 | 2.0
 2 | 10  | 0.8 | 0.2
 2 |  5  | 1.5 | 0.2

The normalization in the interval $[x_l, x_h]$ is:
	$$
	N = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{3} b_k g_k ( \arctan((x_h - x_k) / g_K) \\
				- \arctan((x_l - x_k) / g_k) ) \right]^{-1}
	$$


## Detector influence
The measured distribution is obtained from the true one by applying a limited acceptance probability, a systematic shift and a gaussian smearing. For the standard example, the acceptance probability is
	$$
	p_\text{acc} = 1 - \frac{(x - 1)^2}{2}
	$$

Not accepted events have weight values of 0. The function
	$$
	y_\text{shift} = x - \frac{x}{20}
	$$

shifts the data. The smearing is applied with a standard normal distribution with $\sigma=0.1$.


## Testdata plots
Example of both distribution with 10000 generated numbers is shown below, with the true distribution and after detector effects have been applied.
